        <h6>About Me:</h6>
        <p>I am a junior-level software developer. I am looking to match with a company that will allow for growth, both for me
            and for my employer. The following items are projects that I had fun with / that I felt were good showcases of my
            skills.</p>

        <h2>The Nice or Mean Game</h2>

        <p>This game is coded in Python. Basically, the computer prompts the user to give their name. And then, afterwards
             the computer will give the user a choice. If the choice was Nice, you get a point for nice. If not, then you
             get the score tallied for Mean.</p>
