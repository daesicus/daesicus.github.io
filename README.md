Portfolio Repo


This is my professional Portfolio site. Right now, it is very minimalistic. I have used HTML5, CSS3, JS, Bootstrap 4 for the site. I am planning on working on the portfolio
even more, tightening it up and making it look much more professional. I plan to add some extra functionality besides just linking to my GitHub and other things... I plan many
different things.

I will give updates as I update the project. Feel free to email me @ aaron_alderdyce@hotmail.com , aalderdyce1986@gmail.com .
